Some solutions make use of the utility functions in ccHist.py.
This file is therefore included in the tgz file.
Also, the mass.txt file needed for Exercise 3 is included
in the tgz file

Exercise 1
--------
linux> ./pendulum.py
Note as a bonus this also plots a pull of the calculation
based on the scipy elliptical integral function

Exercise 2
----------
linux> ./juliaSet.py

Exercise 3
----------
linux> ./plotMass.py

Exercise 4
--------
linux> ./decode.py

Exercise 5
--------
linux> ./bisection.py

Exercise 6
---------
linux> ./rungeKutta.py
