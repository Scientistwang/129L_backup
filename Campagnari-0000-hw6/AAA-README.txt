The functions in ccHistStuff.py are sometime
required, therefore they are included in the tgz file

Exercise 1
------------
The Lorentz vector class is LVector.py
Note: as a bonus I have added two member
functions for rotating the 3D part of the
vector in space

Exercise 2
----------
linux> ./poissonPosterior_v2.py

Exercise 3
----------
linux> frequentist.py

Exercise 4
----------
linux> ./ParticleInA2DBox_V2.py
